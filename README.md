# Pepsico-Data-Analytics

In this project i have done analysis on Pepsico dataset

I have used OSEMN framework
Which is Obtain , Scrub , Explore , Model , Interpret

Obtain Stage :

I have used Pesico product data which i got from Kaggle
This data has information of Pepsico's products ( Year : 1863 - 2021 )

Scrub Stage :

Then i started to explore the dataset to find if there is any null values , duplicates and error
In this dataset i didn't found any null values
Then i have removed duplicate values
Then i resolved some errors in the dataset

Explore Stage :

Now it's time to explore the dataset ( Cleaned dataset )

There are total of 191 products

Pepsico has launched more products in Snack category ( 89 products )
Pepsico has launched less product in Food category ( 1 products )

Then i started to explore the status feature
There are total of 154 products which are active and 37 products which are discontinued

Then i started to explore in each region how many products are active and discontinued
North America has the highest count of active ( 94 ) and discontinued ( 36 ) products
There 16 products which are globally available and they are active

There are over 130 products in North America
but in some region like Belgium , Brazil , Spain , France , Europe , United States (New Hampshire) , United States (California) , South Africa , Canada there were few products launched
Pepsico should concentrate on these region
